CERISoNet is a social media website designed for CERI (Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches Internationales) students. It is an academic project developed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

This project serves as my first full JavaScript website, showcasing my skills in building web applications using modern technologies.

Please note that you won't be able to run the application as the database is private and access is restricted.

To learn more about the technologies used in this project and how to set up a similar environment, refer to the documentation or contact the project owner.

Feel free to explore the codebase and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for your interest in CERISoNet!

This is how my WebSite looks like:
